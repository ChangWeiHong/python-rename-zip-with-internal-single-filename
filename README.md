# python-rename-zips-with-internal-single-filename
 
This script is to solve Backupify/Datto mass export naming issues. The zip exported from the platform was coming with random string, but the file in the zip was name with the naming we needed. This script was written to take the name of the file in the zip to rename the parent zip file.

How to use:

1. Put all the zip files to rename in a folder.
2. Install Python 3.9.9
3. Put this script into the folder with all the zip files.
4. Run the script to rename the zip files
